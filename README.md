# CMLS_HW2_Group16_MagicChorus

Repository containing the implementation of a multi-voice chorus audio plugin, using the framework JUCE: we have given it the "commercial name" of 'Magic Chorus'. 
The plugin has the following user parameters: delay, rate, width, mix, which respectively corresponds to the minimum delay applied to the original signal, the frequency of the LFO, the amplitude of its modulation wave, and the balance between the dry and delayed signals. 
Beside these usual chorus parameters, another custom parameter were added.
